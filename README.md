**Energy Savings Calculator**

The Energy Savings Calculator is a user-friendly web application designed to determine the potential energy and cost savings for a rooftop. This tool is invaluable for assessing the financial and environmental benefits of installing energy-efficient materials on rooftops.

**Features**

Rooftop Energy Savings Prediction: The calculator uses inputs such as rooftop area and material to predict potential energy savings. This information empowers users to make informed decisions about energy-efficient upgrades.

Currency Conversion: The application not only estimates energy savings but also converts them into both USD and Kenyan Shillings (KES), enabling users to understand the monetary benefits of their choices.

Interactive Visualization: The calculator presents the calculated savings through an intuitive circular chart. This visualization aids users in comprehending and comparing monthly and annual savings at a glance.

**How to Use**

Input Details: Navigate to the Map intergration component and select coordinates of your building to calculate area, Enter your roof material.

Calculate: Click the "Calculate" button to initiate the energy savings prediction process.

Results: The calculated monthly and annual savings will be displayed in both USD and KES. The circular chart will also visually represent these savings for better understanding.

**Testing and Scalability**

The Energy Savings Calculator has been rigorously tested to ensure its performance and scalability. One notable test involved generating 10,000 user requests concurrently using the Apache Beam framework. This test confirms the application's ability to handle a high volume of users without compromising its responsiveness.
